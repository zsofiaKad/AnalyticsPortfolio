**Question Level of Difficulty**: Medium


### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(quantity_sold * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM candy_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```


### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Calculate revenue for each sale:**
   - Revenue for each sale is calculated by multiplying `quantity_sold` by `price_per_unit`. This determines the total revenue generated for each candy item.

2. **Group sales by category:**
   - Use `GROUP BY category` to aggregate all sales by the `category` column. This ensures the query calculates totals for each unique candy category (e.g., Sweets, Chocolate).

3. **Aggregate total revenue for each category:**
   - Apply `SUM(quantity_sold * price_per_unit)` to compute the total revenue for each candy category.

4. **Sort categories by revenue:**
   - Use `ORDER BY total_revenue DESC` to sort the results in descending order, showcasing the top-performing categories first.


**Result**

| category   | total_revenue |
|------------|---------------|
| Chocolate  | 76            |
| Sweets     | 51.75         |
