2. What is the difference in the number of listed properties between the two datasets?
3. What parameters influence the price of properties?
4. Are the parameters that influence price the same across both data sources?
5. Did you find any properties listed in both sources? If so, is the valuation consistent?
6. In which data source is there more price volatility? Is there any observable seasonality?
7. Can you create a truly unique dataset by merging the two dataframes?
8. Is there any variable we could add to improve the analysis?
9. Can you create a ranking of the most expensive properties?
10. Which properties are the most profitable?
11. Based on all the knowledge acquired, what are your suggestions for investing 300 million euros?
